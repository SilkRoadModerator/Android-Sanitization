# Making an untraceable smartphone...

### Let’s talk about… anonymity. Today we will talk about the security of our mobile phones. Let’s start with hadware…

    REQUIREMENTS:
    ├MTK 65xx/67xx series processor
    ├GhostPhone (to change IMEI)
    ├mute camera and microphone
    └ refusal to use a SIM card

We need MTK 65xx / 67xx to support GhostPhone (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rungetel.ghostphone&hl=ru&gl=US), which allows you to change the real IMEI of the smartphone. By IMEI, the phone is tracked by the cellular operator. Even without a SIM card in it. We remove the SIM card. You will link online services to a virtual phone number. You will be contacted through secure services. Traffic will go through an external modem and will be covered by VPN+TOR. We make it possible to physically block the camera (https://aliexpress.ru/item/4000898406193.html) and the microphone (https://aliexpress.ru/item/1005003187958314.html).

What did we get? A device that does not transmit information via GSM does not have a phone number and a permanent IMEI by which it could be tracked through a telecom operator. In case of remote activation, the camera and microphone can be blocked manually.

### With physical security sorted out, now consider alternative operating systems. You will be surprised, but there are a lot of them:

### MOBILE OS

    https://ubuntu-touch.io/
    https://lineageos.org/
    https://sailfishos.org/
    https://www.kali.org/get-kali/
    https://grapheneos.org/
    https://source.android.com/

Alternative OSes focus on greater privacy and security for their users. This means that they (most likely) store less user data, and also that it is much more difficult to query for this data.

What did we get? A device that does not collect or transmit information (But this is not accurate) about its users to key IT corporations (Google, Apple, Facebook, well, or Yandex). Presumably, such a device is also not subject to tracking through ADINT (advertising identifiers). Of course, subject to the rules of digital hygiene.

### Browsers with increased anonymity and search engines to match them …

### BROWSERS

    https://www.torproject.org/download/
    https://www.epicbrowser.com/
    https://brave.com/download/
    https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browsers/mobile/focus/
    https://duckduckgo.com/app
    https://www.inbrowserapp.com/
    https://www.opera.com/ru/browsers)

### SEARCH ENGINES

    https://darksearch.io/
    http://hss3uro2hsxfogfq.onion/
    http://xmh57jrzrnw6insl.onion/
    https://duckduckgo.com/
    https://swisscows.com/
    https://gibiru.com/
    https://www.startpage.com/
    https://qwant.com/

What did we get? Get rid of tracking modules built into popular browsers and search engines. Add a quality VPN and you’ll be even more secure.

### Let’s talk about other software…

### Messenger:

    https://signal.org/
    https://briarproject.org/
    https://www.jabber.ru/
    https://element.io/

### Email:

    https://runbox.com/
    https://www.preveil.com/
    https://www.zoho.com/mail/

### File sharing:

    https://dropmefiles.com/
    https://send.reeves.su/
    https://privatlab.com/
    https://onionshare.org/
    https://www.sync.com/

### Cloud storage:

    https://mega.io/
    https://nextcloud.com/
    https://nordlocker.com/

As a result, we have the maximum possible disposal of tracking modules built into popular applications, as well as minimizing the risks of transferring your data to third parties.
